## Description:
Foodora is my college project, a user-friendly food delivery app created with Flutter for iOS and Android. Powered by Google Firebase, it features a reliable backend with Cloud Firestore for data management. The app includes a User App for customers, Sellers App for restaurants, and Riders App for delivery personnel, all managed through an Admin Web Portal. Streamlining updates is made easy with Firebase App Distribution. This project demonstrates my proficiency in app development and backend management, offering a comprehensive solution for the entire food delivery process.
